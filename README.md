Software Design & Quality Course Project

The task  is to create a skeleton or outline of a test plan document for another project.

Test Plan Document for Virginia Tech Smart Parking System (Link: https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/cs5744-vt-smart-parking/modules?authuser=0)

###Test Scope: 

Provide a brief description of the specific functional, performance, and internal design characteristics that will cover in test plan--only integration and validation testing.

###Test Plan: 
Devise and present a series of integration phases and corresponding partial system builds for incrementally testing identifiable pieces of the system. Introduce the phases, describe which parts of the system are included in each phase, and then briefly argue why this is the best approach to integration testing the chosen design.

###Test Procedure for Build: 
For each separate phase/build identified in the test plan, describe a specific test procedure. This include a brief description of the main purpose of the build (i.e., which specific functional/performance/design characteristics are to be tested here), and a listing of the specific test case skeletons for the test cases that have planned to perform. 

###Validation Tests: 
In addition to the integration tests, also plan the validation tests. It is organized around a traceability matrix that maps the validation test case skeletons to the requirements for the project.
