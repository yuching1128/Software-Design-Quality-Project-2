        <b>Authors: </b>Raghavi Vannala, Swati Lamba, Yuching Lin, Yuechen Feng<br>
        The system to be tested is the VT smart parking system. The system would enable the users to buy various types
        of Parking permits offered and then show the user the nearest spot available based on the category of the users
        like students and staff and bill the user for the parking.
        <br>Since this is black box testing, we have based our testing plan on the functionalities and project
        requirements.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-left-align" id="requirements">Requirements Tested</h2>
      <p class="w3-left-align">
        The scope of this test plan will cover all of the functional requirements and some of the non-functional
        requirements as listed below.

      </p>
      <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
      <ul class="w3-left-align">
        <li id="fr1">FR-1. The System should provide a login and logout functionality using the Virginia Tech PID and a
          user-defined password.
        </li>
        <li id="fr2">FR-2. The System should be GPS-enabled in order to take in the user’s live location.</li>
        <li id="fr3">FR-3. The System should suggest available Parking slots using the user’s location in ascending
          order of distance.</li>
        <li id="fr4">FR-4. The System should leverage image processing to capture if a certain Parking slot is
          available. Based on this availability, the System should update the database and also return the same results
          to the user</li>
        <li id="fr5">FR-5. The System should allow the user to search for the various Parking lots across campus.
        </li>
        <li id="fr6">FR-6. The System should let the user book and pay for the Parking spot using Parking permits.</li>
        <li id="fr7">FR-7. In case the user does not have an already existing Parking permit, the System should allow
          the user to buy a fresh Parking permit.</li>
        <li id="fr8">FR-8. The System should enable the user to enter their details.
        </li>
        <li id="fr9">FR-9. The System should display the Parking duration and Parking details.
        </li>
        <li id="fr10">FR-10. The System should allow Parking owners to visualize parking patterns.
          Assumption: It will be a graph with the parking slot locations and times showing the user trend of the parking
          availability over the last n days.</li>
        <li id="fr11">FR-11(NFR-5). The application must be able to store the Parking information of the student within
          the past 90 days. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
      <ul class="w3-left-align">
        <li id="nfr1"> NFR-1. The Smart Parking application should be able to run both on Android (version 7 and above)
          and iOS (version 10 and above).
        </li>
        <p class="w3-left-align">
          It is assumed that the application is responsive with the load time of maximum 5 seconds and response time of
          maximum 3 seconds. This ensures the users do not have to wait too long and lose interest.
          The scalability testing is also included which will test application to accommodate maximum (50,000 approx)
          requests made by the VT students and staff.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="w3-left-align" id="outofscope">Requirements not tested</h2>
      <p class="w3-left-align">
        This test plan will focus on ensuring the system as a whole as well as the individual components function as
        defined by the requirements. As such, some of the specific details of how the components operate internally will
        not be tested.

        The following requirements are not specifically targeted by this test plan. Depending on how the tests are
        implemented and configured it is possible one or more of these requirements will be covered in this plan.

        We will also not be covering the recovery and durability testing ruling out considering the NFR-3 and NFR-4.
      <ul class="w3-left-align">
        <li> NFR-2. Any Student data will be encrypted with the required encryption standards.</li>
        <li> NFR-3. The application must have an uptime of 99.7 percent.</li>
        <li>NFR-4. The System shall be capable of recovering from an application or System failure, leaving the
          application and System in an operable state.</li>
        <li>NFR-6. The Application should address future requirement changes or handle new requirements.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- The Test Plan Section -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="testplan">
      <h1>Test Plan</h1>
      <h3 class="w3-left-align">Plan Overview</h3>
      <p class="w3-left-align">
        The test plan has been divided into six phases. Each phase has main objective of testing the functionalities of
        the system. The phases have been designed in an incremental fashion. The first phase has all the independent
        functionalities covered which will be used and integrated with the functionalities that will be tested in upcoming
        phases. The first five phases cover the functional testing and integration testing of the application. The last
        phase is for the load and performance testing.
      </p>
      <h4 class="w3-left-align">Reason to choose this plan:</h4>
      <p class="w3-left-align">
        The objective of the testing is to test and evaluate the functionality of the application in an incremental
        fashion. The division of the phases for the testing we have chosen is based on the logical progression of the
        functionality development as it would be blackbox testing. So that the testing can start as soon as a
        functionality is completed and all the independent functionalities as well as the basic functionalities on which
        the other functionalities are built upon should be completed first. For example, the Parking Trends Service is
        in phase 5 because it depends on Parking booking services, location services and parking history services. This
        helps make the testing easy to consider all the necessary cases at once.<br>
        Below is Table 1.1 depicting all the phases with respective requirements and dependencies.

        Once all the test phases are completed successfully, the final product needs to verified and validated against
        the original requirements mentioned. For that, we have created the below 56 test cases which can be used to
        complete
        the validation testing. With the help of <a href="#traceabilitymatrix">Traceability Matrix Table 1.2</a>, we can
        ensure the final product meets all the customer requirements.

        It is important to recognize that it is impossible to cover every possible testing scenario. The strategy
        outlined in this plan focuses on the functional, integration and performance testing of the VT Parking System.
        The test plan should evolve as the design of the system evolves and requirements are refined. This test
        plan provides a solid foundation to begin implementing testing strategies that will contribute to better
        software quality.
